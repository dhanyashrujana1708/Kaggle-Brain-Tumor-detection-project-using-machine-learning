# Brain Tumor Detection Using BRATS Dataset

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting brain tumors from MRI scans using machine learning/deep learning techniques. The model is trained on the BRATS (Brain Tumor Segmentation) dataset to identify the presence of brain tumors and support automated medical image analysis.
